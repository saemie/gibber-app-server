# gibber-app-server

## Keywords / Jargon

- Room. Right now there is only one. Hence, Main Room.

## Single booth prototype

Room gets spun up before the server starts listening for connections.
Show number of users in the room.

I'll start creating modules out of the code in `server.js` soon.

Features:

- Look into the peer-to-peer stun/turn signalling (fun fun... Document it this time!)
- Session management with cookies etc
- Broadcaster, choose whether they appoint themselves or automatically appointed
- Destroy the room, kick users

## Stream List

Features:

- Audio visualiser always on for all.
- Sound on on list-item hover.

Implementation:

- User gets added to all rooms by default?
